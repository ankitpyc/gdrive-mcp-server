# Background Context

I would like to build an MCP server for Google Drive . The choice of language for implementation should be golang and fast mcp . The MCP server should have the following tools available 

- fetch the list of root level folders 
- given a file content and a path on the google drive create a file in the path
- suggest based on the name of the folder which folder this kind of content goes 


# Task to be accomplished 

- Come up with a very detailed plan of how you would like to acheive this 
- this whole mcp server can be dokerized so that it can be used later anywhere 
- follow the clean code practices and well structured maintainable code so that capabilities can be easily extended
